# Blackjack
“Blackjack” game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game allows the user to start the game and be given two randomly
generated card numbers within a specified range. They then have the option to generate a further card to continue to try and
reach the desired number of ‘21’. The game will also indicate if the user has gone over this number or if they win.
